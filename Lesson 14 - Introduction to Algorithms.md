# Introduction to Algorithms






## Q1

âœ… Problem solving is a systematic approach to define and solve a problem.

â—»ï¸Ž The order to solve a problem is to first provide the solution followed by the problem definition.

âœ… Few techniques are required to solve a particular problem which help in deriving a logic to solve the problem.

â—»ï¸Ž Algorithms, Flowcharts, Pie Charts are some of the techniques of problem solving.

âœ… Algorithms,Flowcharts, Pseudo Code and Programs are the techniques used to solve a problem.


ðŸ§  Explanation (Layman Terms): Think of solving a problem like following a recipe:

First, understand what dish you want (problem definition).

Then gather tools like flowcharts and algorithms (recipe steps).

Pie charts are for data visualization, not steps in solving problems!


## Q2

â—»ï¸Ž Algorithm means a mathematical formula.

âœ… It is very easy to write the code in any programming language after developing an algorithm for that problem.

â—»ï¸Ž Only one algorithm can be written for any problem.

âœ… After a finite number of steps an algorithm must reach an end state.

ðŸ§  Explanation: An algorithm is just a clear step-by-step instruction â€” like how to make a sandwich:

Take bread â†’ add peanut butter â†’ add jelly â†’ put the top bread.

There can be many ways to make a sandwich â€” similarly, multiple algorithms can solve the same problem.

## Q3

â—»ï¸Ž The more time an algorithm takes to execute, the better is the algorithm.

âœ… The lesser memory a program takes to execute, better is the algorithm.

â—»ï¸Ž Only one algorithm can be written for any problem and is the only preferred way.

â—»ï¸Ž The quality of an algorithm is determined by the person who wrote it.

ðŸ§  Explanation: Good algorithms are like smart shortcuts:

Use less memory, run faster, and give the correct answer.

Itâ€™s not about who writes it, but how efficiently it runs.


## Q4


```python
miles = int(input("miles: "))
if (miles > 0):
    print("kilometers:",miles*1.609)
    # convert the given miles into kilometers and print the result
    
else:
    print("not positive value")

```

miles = int(input("Enter distance in miles: "))
if miles > 0:
    km = miles * 1.609
    print(f"{miles} miles = {km:.2f} kilometers")
else:
    print("Please enter a positive value.")
ðŸ§  Explanation:

1 mile = 1.609 kilometers.

The program checks if the input is positive before converting.

Example:
Enter distance in miles: 10
10 miles = 16.09 kilometers

## Q5


```python
t=input("temp with unit: ")
g=t[0:-1]
n=int(g)
x=t[-1:]
s=['c','C','f','F']
if x in s:
    if (x=='c')or (x=='C'):
        a=n*9/5+32
        y=round(a,2)
        print(n,"C =",y,"F")

    else:
        b=(5/9)*(n-32)
        z=round(b,2)
        print(n,"F =",z,"C")
else:
    print("unrecognized unit:",x)
```
ðŸ§  Explanation:

It extracts the number and the last letter (unit: C/F).

Then it converts accordingly.

Example:
Input: 100F
Output: 100Â°F = 37.78Â°C

Input: 0C
Output: 0Â°C = 32.0Â°F
